# redis-utils
A set of Redis utils to query, extract, backup and more.
## loadKeys.js
 - Loads all keys in a DB using the KEYS statement of redis.
 - Writes a json file that includes the result of the statement.
 - The resulting file will be a necessary payload for *search.js* and *backup.js*
## search.js
 - Loads all keys using the json file generated by *loadKeys.js*
 - Performs a loop search looking for entries that meet all the _queries_ array.
 - There's no resulting file, and the result's displayed in console.
## backup.js
 - Loads all keys using the json file generated by *loadKeys.js*
 - Writes an array of json's with the key and value of all entries of the key file.
