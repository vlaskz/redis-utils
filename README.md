# Redis-utils
A set of Redis utils to query and perform ETL functions (extract, transform, load).
### loadKeys.js - Load keys in a file.
 - Loads all keys in a DB using the KEYS statement of redis.
 - Writes a json file that includes the result of the statement.
 - The resulting file will be a necessary payload for *search.js* and *backup.js*
### search.js - Search for entries.
 - Loads all keys using the json file generated by *loadKeys.js*
 - Performs a loop search looking for entries that meet all the _queries_ array.
 - There's no resulting file, and the result's displayed in console.
### backup.js - Backup entire DB
 - Loads all keys using the json file generated by *loadKeys.js*
 - Writes an array of json's with the key and value of all entries of the key file.

##TODO's:
 - A new Auth system (maybe an external file containing credentials, maybe accepting as CLI arguments)
 - Refactor to match some design patterns (Factories, Facades, Singletons) and avoid async runout.
 - Make the output of *search.js* pipeable. It means it can be redirected to a console.log, printed, or treated as a plain Json Object.
 - Add test coverage.
 - Expand functionality to perform on all Redis DataTypes: Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets, Bitmaps and HyperLogLogs.
 - Implement *backup.js* incremental and differential modes.
